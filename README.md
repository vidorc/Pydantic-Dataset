Pydantic Patient Data Model
This project demonstrates the use of Pydantic for data validation and settings management using a Patient data model. It defines the structure for patient information, including type hints and validation rules.

üöÄ Features
Strict Data Typing: Ensures that fields like name, email, age, and weight adhere to their defined types (e.g., str, EmailStr, int).

Value Constraints: Applies validation rules, such as max_length for strings and greater-than/less-than constraints for numbers.

Complex Types: Handles nested data structures like lists (allergies) and dictionaries (contact_details).

Optional Fields: Allows certain fields like married and allergies to be optional with default values.

Automatic Type Coercion: Pydantic intelligently converts compatible types, such as a string "30" into an integer 30 for the age field.
